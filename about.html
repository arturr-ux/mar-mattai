        <h1>About The Monastery</h1>
        <p>Mar Mattai monastery is located on the slope of an upside-down mountain called mount
            alfaf in Syriac (35-38km) away northeast of Mosul -Iraq It was founded in the fourth
            century around 363 by the monk Mar Mattai. The monastery took the name of Saint
            Matthew, as he was its founder, and he was appointed the first abbot of the monastery. Followed by many of monks and the monotheists of Nineveh, Iraq and Persia</p>
        <p>A hundred years after the monastery was founded, it was exposed to a major fire that led
            to the obliteration of its features and the disappearance of the inscriptions and
            decorations. However, the Monastic life returned to it in the fifth century as the name of
            the monastery emerged in 544 and continued until 1171 but it was abandoned due to
            attacks by the residents of the region and remained abandoned for about 16 years. The
            monastery lived a lot of turbulent periods and it witnessed disturbances until the
            criminals inhabited it and expelled the monks from it and it was left</p>
            <p>This cycle of disturbances and the return of life to the monastery continued until 1970
                when father Isaac Saka restored the monastery to keep pace with development. He
                modified many aspects of the monastery but left a part of it so that its history wouldnâ€™t
                be lost. And finished restoring it in 1973.</p>
                <p>After that, everyone who headed the monastery made minor modifications to it until we
                    reached our current time, as there are no fixed historical documents that show us the
                    shape and design of the first monastery or the plan for construction due to the changes
                    and problems that the monastery went through but;</p>

                    <h4>Mar Mattai Monastery Digitalization</h4>
                    <p>Mar Mattai Monastery is one of the most important monasteries in Iraq founded in 363. However, conflicts and problems occurred during the past years leading to the erasure of most of its features.
                        The inscriptions and decorations are barely present now. Hence, our project aims to 3D scan the monastery and build a 3D model to preserve it for the next generations.</p>    </div>
